## [v0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2025-10-24
### 🚀 Overview
Initial **alpha release** of the **RawStack API Core** — the first component of the RawStack platform.  
This marks the starting point for the open-source backend foundation of the RawStack ecosystem.

- **CLI (Nest Commander)** for migrations and admin utilities
- **Environment configuration** via `.env` and `@nestjs/config`
- **Initial Jest test suite** for unit and e2e testing
- **Docker and Prisma setup** for local development

### 🧱 Scope
Included in this release:
- `apps/api` — RawStack API Core

Planned for future alphas:
- `apps/app` — Mobile application

- `apps/web` — React + Vite frontend
- `apps/admin` — Admin dashboard

### ⚙️ Notes
This is an **alpha** release intended for preview and testing.

## [v0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-01-09
### 🚀 Overview
This alpha expands the RawStack platform beyond the API and mobile app by introducing **API versioning**, the initial **Admin Dashboard**, and the **public website**.

Coming in future alphas:
- `infra/` — Deployment & infrastructure configuration
- Expanded admin and web functionality

### ⚙️ Notes
This is a **platform alpha**.  
API versioning is expected to evolve, and both the admin dashboard and website are early foundations that will be iterated on significantly in upcoming releases.
