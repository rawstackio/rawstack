## [v0.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-05-07
### 🚀 Overview
This release focuses on **hardening authentication security** across the API and Admin Dashboard by migrating refresh token handling to **HttpOnly cookies**, eliminating client-side token storage.

### ✨ Added
- **HttpOnly cookie-based refresh tokens** (`apps/api`) ⭐
    - The `/auth/tokens` endpoint now supports an `auth-context: browser` request header, returning the refresh token as a secure HttpOnly cookie instead of in the JSON response body
    - Added a new `/auth/refresh-token-cookies` endpoint for securely clearing the refresh-token cookie on logout
    - Added `cookie-parser` and `@types/cookie-parser` dependencies to the API to support cookie-based authentication
- **Admin logout cookie clearing** (`apps/admin`)
    - Logout flow now calls `/auth/refresh-token-cookies` to ensure the HttpOnly refresh-token cookie is cleared server-side on logout
- **Concurrent development workflow** (`apps/admin`)
    - Added a `dev:full` script for running the admin app concurrently with the local `api-client` package
    - Improved Vite configuration to support hot-reloading when developing against the local `api-client` package

### ♻️ Refactored
- **Refresh token storage** (`apps/admin`) ⭐
    - Removed all references to storing refresh tokens in local storage or any client-accessible storage
    - Cleaned up related types and token management logic across the frontend for improved security and maintainability
- **API client package** (`packages/api-client`)
    - Updated for compatibility with the new cookie-based auth flow and modern module resolution
    - OpenAPI spec and generated TypeScript client updated to reflect the `auth-context` header and new `/auth/refresh-token-cookies` endpoint

### 🧱 Scope
Included in this release:
- `apps/api` — RawStack API Core (HttpOnly cookie auth, cookie-parser, new refresh endpoint)
- `apps/admin` — Admin Dashboard (cookie-based logout, token storage cleanup, dev workflow)
- `packages/api-client` — API Client (updated spec and module resolution)

### ⚙️ Notes
The shift to HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens is a **breaking change** for any clients relying on the refresh token being present in the `/auth/tokens` JSON response body when using a browser context. Clients must pass the `auth-context: browser` header to opt in to cookie-based token delivery. Non-browser clients (e.g. the mobile app) are unaffected.

## [v0.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-05-01
### 🚀 Overview
This release is headlined by the **migration of the web app to a server-action-based Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) architecture**, introducing secure server-side session management for all authentication flows. Supporting changes include an admin app authentication refactor, theme management improvements, dependency updates, and general codebase maintenance across the monorepo.

### ✨ Added
- **Server Actions & BFF architecture** (`apps/web`) ⭐
    - Introduced server-side auth actions (`apps/web/src/actions/auth.ts` and `apps/web/src/actions/user.ts`) using **Next.js Server Actions** as the BFF layer for all API interactions
    - All authentication flows (login, logout, registration, user fetching, account updates, account deletion) now go through secure server-side actions — the browser never directly calls the API
    - Integrated **iron-session** for encrypted, cookie-based server-side session storage of access tokens, refresh tokens, and session metadata
    - Added `SESSION_SECRET` to `.env.dist` for session encryption configuration
    - Added a `debug` script to the web app for easier local development

### ♻️ Refactored
- **Web app error handling** (`apps/web`) ⭐
    - Server actions now return typed discriminated union results (`{ ok: true, ... } | { ok: false, error: { statusCode, type, message } }`) instead of throwing, eliminating the issue of custom error classes losing their prototype during Next.js serialization
    - Client-side forms and hooks check `result.ok` rather than relying on `instanceof ApiError`, making 409/conflict errors correctly handled in registration and account update flows
- **Admin app authentication** (`apps/admin`)
    - Extracted API initialization and token refresh logic into a new `useApiInit` hook, de-duplicating auth logic in `AuthProvider`
- **Admin app theme management** (`apps/admin`)
    - Refactored theme persistence and toggling logic
    - Removed `next-themes` dependency in favour of a simplified custom `AppProvider`

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Admin app** cookie-based storage provider — cleaned up error handling and removed unnecessary try/catch blocks
- **API** seed script — fixed Prisma import path for better compatibility
- **API** controller response types updated for improved type safety and consistency

### ⬆️ Updated
- **Version bumps** — all major packages (`apps/admin`, `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/api-client`, `apps/app`) bumped to `v0.1.0-beta.3`
- **TypeScript configs** — added `ignoreDeprecations` to suppress deprecation warnings ahead of TypeScript 6.0

### 🧱 Scope
Included in this release:
- `apps/web` — Public Website (server actions BFF, iron-session, error handling)
- `apps/admin` — Admin Dashboard (auth refactor, theme management)
- `apps/api` — RawStack API Core (type safety, seed script fix)
- `packages/api-client` — API Client (version bump)
- `apps/app` — RawStack Mobile App (version bump)

### ⚙️ Notes
The server action BFF pattern established in this release is the recommended approach for all future web app API interactions. The `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable must be set before running the web app — see `apps/web/README.md` for setup instructions.

## [v0.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-04-14
### 🐛 Fixed
- **Prisma client module resolution** (`apps/api`)
    - Updated Prisma client imports to use `@generated/prisma` custom module path
    - Added Jest `moduleNameMapper` configuration for test compatibility
    - Updated TypeScript path mappings in `tsconfig.json`

---
